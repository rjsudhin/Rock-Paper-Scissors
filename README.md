Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game! This is a classic hand game played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible shapes are Rock, Paper, and Scissors. The rules are simple:

    Rock crushes Scissors

The game is typically played in a best-of-three or best-of-five format, but this implementation allows for a single round.
